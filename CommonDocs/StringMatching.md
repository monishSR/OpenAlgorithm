Implements several String Matching Algorithms

String matching is a problem where a given `pattern` of length `m` has to be searched in given `text` of size `n`, and if the `text` contains the `pattern`, the first matching index `i` has to be returned.

## Note
In UML Class Diagram above __bold__ represents `static` members, actually they have to be underlined, since github markdown doesn't support underline, __bold__ is used
All UML Class Diagrams will be replaced by their Image equivalents soon
